This mode allows you to create the fields and titles that make up a screen
design.  Just move the cursor anywhere on the screen and type.
Remember these rules:

 *  Any text with a colon after it will be considered a field.

 *  You can have up to 32 separate pages in a form design.
 *  For best results, the colons in field names should line up vertically.

{Special keys:}

<CONTROL> <P>	- move to the previous page (if it exists)
<CONTROL> <N>	- move to the next page (only 32 pages are allowed)

48{Not enough room}


There is not enough room to save the current screen form to disk!
Unfortunately, if it can't be saved, then your entire file will be destroyed.
You can try removing titles and fields until the form is small enough to be
saved.  If you have a backup copy of the file, then you might just want to exit
and use the other copy.
In the future, be sure there is enough room on the disk before you alter the
screen form.

 *  If you want to edit the screen form again, select "NO"\

100{DOS Error}


There is no help entry for this error.  Look in your DOS manual for a full
explanation.\
101{Not enough memory for sort}


There is not enough memory to attempt the sort.  You can either free up some
high memory, or try to print again without a sort.\
103{Can't copy a file to itself}


Your source and destination filenames are the same!  Change one of the
filenames and try again.\
104{Screen form has no fields}


DATA-MINDER requires that a screen form have at least one field.  Add a field
and try again.\
105{Screen form has too many fields}


DATA-MINDER allows a maximum of 128 field per screen.  Reduce the number of
fields and try again.\
106{Help error}\
107{File format not supported}


This file was created by a previous version of DATA-MINDER.\
108{Not a DATA-MINDER file}


The file that you indicated was not created by DATA-MINDER!  Type in an
appropriate filename and try again.\
109{Write protected disk}


The file you wanted to read is on a write protected disk!  Either remove the
write-protect tab, or use another disk.\
110{Illegal file name}


This filename is not in the correct format!  The correct format allows only the
letters "A" through "Z", and the numbers "0" through "9".  A number cannot be
the first character of the filename.  A proper filename is of the form:
  FILENAME/EXT.PASSWORD

Type in the corrected filename and try again.\
111{File not in directory}


The file you wanted to load could not be found.  You might not have the proper
disk in a disk drive, or you may have mistyped the filename.  An open drive
door is another possibility.  Depending on your problem, either put in the
correct disk, re-type the filename, or shut the drive door and try again.\
112{Disk space full}


There is not enough space left on the disk to complete the save.  You can free
up space on the disk and try again, or you can move the file to a disk with
more room.\
113{Illegal drive number}


The drive that you specified is not in your system.  Either you made a mistake
in typing, or there might be a hardware problem.  Try re-typing the filename.
If that doesn't work, look in your DOS manual for additional information.\
114{File access denied}


The file you wanted to load is password protected.  Either the password you
specified is wrong, or you didn't specify one.  Use the correct password and
try again.\
